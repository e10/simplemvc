{"name":"Simplemvc","tagline":"Very Simple MVC for php","body":"simplemvc\r\n=========\r\n\r\nI always wanted to use bootstrap but then its help and not help, specially for someone as lazy as me. So I decided to write this small project that takes care of almost all the requirement I normally end of using. this project uses following items.\r\n\r\n1. jQuery\r\n2. jQuery UI\r\n3. Twitter Bootstrap\r\n4. WYSIWYG HTML5 (Bootstrap)\r\n5. KnockoutJS\r\n6. Modernizr\r\n\r\nThis also creates a simple controller and views directories with respective .php files to run as mvc. This project has Web.Config (I am a windows & IIS user mostly). But you are welcome to add a apache .htaccess file as well.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions and queries you can email simplemvc@e10.in and will try to answer as quick as possible. you can send you questions to [@e10in](https://twitter.com/e10in) on twitter as well.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
