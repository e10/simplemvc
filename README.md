simplemvc
=========

I always wanted to use bootstrap but then its help and not help, specially for someone as lazy as me. So I decided to write this small project that takes care of almost all the requirement I normally end of using. this project uses following items.

1. jQuery
2. jQuery UI
3. Twitter Bootstrap
4. WYSIWYG HTML5 (Bootstrap)
5. KnockoutJS
6. Modernizr

This also creates a simple controller and views directories with respective .php files to run as mvc. This project has Web.Config (I am a windows & IIS user mostly). But you are welcome to add a apache .htaccess file as well.

If you have any questions and queries you can email simplemvc@e10.in and will try to answer as quick as possible. you can send you questions to [@e10in](https://twitter.com/e10in) on twitter as well.
